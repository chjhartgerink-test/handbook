This is our collective handbook, where we collect the resources needed to create a shared understanding of how we work. Some of it is descriptive (how we actually work), some of it is prescriptive (how we should work). 

How we work is continuously evolving, so we encourage suggested edits! This also means reading up regularly to ensure you are aware of changes.

[^1]: LibScie is the preferred acronym of Liberate Science.
